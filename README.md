# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Analyze all the Pyber, rideshare app, data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO and manger Omar.

1. Create line, bar, scatter, bubble, pie, and box-and-whisker plots using Python and Jupyter notebook.
2. Add and modify features of Matplotlib charts.
3. Add error bars to line and bar charts.
4. Determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1 Jupyter Notebook

The analysis of the rideshare data show that:
- There were three types of cities: Urban, Suburban and Rural
- Within the three types:
  -Urban had 66 cities
  -Suburban had 36 cities
  -Rural had 18 cities
- The largest to smallest types of cities were in order from Urban, Suburban and Rural.
  -Urban cities sum of fares were (63%) $39,854.
  -Suburban cities sum of fares were (30%) $19,356.
  -Rural cities sum of fares were (7%) $4,327
  -The total amount of fares collected were $63,538.
- The most activity came from Urban cities.
-The total drivers were broken down by city type:
  -Drivers from Urban cities made up about 81% of total drivers analyzed 
  -Drivers from Suburban cities made up about 16% of total drivers analyzed
  -Drivers from Urban cities made up about 3% of total drivers analyzed

## Challenge Overview
The CEO asked for more analysis in regards to total rides, drivers and fares per city types.
-Rural cities had:
  -125 total rides
  -78 drivers
  -Collected $4,327.93
-Suburban cities had:
  -625 total rides
  -490 drivers
  -Collected $19,356.33
-Urban cities had:
  -1625 total rides
  -2405 drivers
  -Collected $39,854.38

## Challenge Summary
We used total rides, drivers and fares to calculate averages per ride and driver.
- The fares per ride were:
  -$34.62 in Rural cities
  -$30.97 in Suburban cities
  -$24.53 in Urban cities
- The fares per driver were:
  -$55.49 in Rural cities
  -$39.50 in Suburban cities
  -$16.57 in Urban cities
